## Technical Requirements Used

 - The persons who are not familiar with the game, a brief presentation was prepared. [General overview of game](https://my.visme.co/view/pvg6v8mw-64r50v1747462pz1)
 - The dataset selected was from this public site. [League of Legends Champioships](https://oracleselixir.com/matchdata/)
 - From this dataset was neccesary to sepparate *Date* from *Date-Time* column, also was neccesary to aggregate column of ***KDA*** which will tell us the total score per player in champioships.

) was neccesary to obtain a basic table, the information is basic stats from all the existing champions or selectable characters.

## Looking Objectives

* __The insight of information__: This is inferred from visualizations. The objectives to question and solve are:
    1. What was the perform per team, which was the most competitive countries in **worlds championship**.
    2. Which were the MVP, by league & country, knowing it from ***KDA*** 
    3. What was the key positions, according to the MVP's
    4. What was the most selectable and banned champions and which relation are between this visualization.
    5. Comparing the actual champion and always favorite team, who has more probabilities to reach the last match of thie year.

For a future analysis, it is proposed to take into account team play style taking into account different statistics to those already included in this project.
