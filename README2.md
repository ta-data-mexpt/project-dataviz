This project represents my first one in terms of data visualization. I wanted to explore a topic related to education in Mexico, since I believe there is a lot to be done in that area and it's one of our main pillars as society.

I used data from the results of the standarized test applied to students in key moments of their education: 6th grade, 9th grade, and 12th grade. This data was retrieved from the government's official site of the test, which is called PLANEA: https://historico.mejoredu.gob.mx/evaluaciones/planea/

It was a great challenge for me to clean up and merge the data so it could all be in one data set. Here is the link to how I cleaned them (Cleaning Data.ipynb),the final databases that came from this process, and a 5 min. presentation that resumes the insights I came with (An√°lisis PLANEA Proyecto Data Viz.pptx):

All my simple, but powerful visualizations were made with Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/views/AnlisisPruebaPLANEA/EdosCrticos?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

I exposed this matter via twitch. Here is the video of the presentation (My turn starts at 1hr:10min): https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1065615135?tt_medium=mobile_web_share&tt_content=vod
