34632,F. Scott Fitzgerald,"In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write ""something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned."" That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became The Great Gatsby, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--"" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. ""Her voice is full of money,"" Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, The Great Gatsby is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.",,Paperback,9.78068E+12,182,3.9,3143851,57009,The Great Gatsby,Classics|Fiction|Academic|School|Literature|Historical|Historical Fiction|Romance|Novels|Academic|Read For School|Young Adult|High School|Literature|American,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1325225271l/210090.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Academic,School

With the arrival of eligible young men in their neighborhood, the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and their five daughters are turned inside out and upside down. Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity, as misconceptions and hasty judgements lead to heartache and scandal, but eventually to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love. In this supremely satisfying story, Jane Austen balances comedy with seriousness, and witty observation with profound insight.

And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: ""It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."" She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet ""as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print"". Readers of Pride and Prejudice would be hard-pressed to disagree. --Alix Wilber",,Hardcover,9.78068E+12,368,4.25,2455518,54371,Pride and Prejudice,Classics|Fiction|Romance,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1175020358l/468003.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Romance,

43601,J.R.R. Tolkien|Peter Sís,"""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."" The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a ""little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves."" He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, ""looking for someone to share in an adventure,"" Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure. The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, The Lord of the Rings, would eventually spring. Though The Hobbit is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. --Alix Wilber",,Paperback,9.78062E+12,330,4.26,2424429,41383,The Hobbit,Fantasy|Classics|Fiction|Adventure|Young Adult|Science Fiction Fantasy|Fantasy|High Fantasy|Childrens|Fantasy|Epic Fantasy|Novels,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437279343l/554286.jpg,Fantasy,Classics,Fiction,Adventure

Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and even to the heart of the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair... a secret location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation.

39274,George Orwell,"Since its publication in 1946, George Orwell's fable of a workers' revolution gone wrong has rivaled Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea as the Shortest Serious Novel It's OK to Write a Book Report About. (The latter is three pages longer and less fun to read.) Fueled by Orwell's intense disillusionment with Soviet Communism, Animal Farm is a nearly perfect piece of writing, both an engaging story and an allegory that actually works. When the downtrodden beasts of Manor Farm oust their drunken human master and take over management of the land, all are awash in collectivist zeal. Everyone willingly works overtime, productivity soars, and for one brief, glorious season, every belly is full. The animals' Seven Commandment credo is painted in big white letters on the barn. All animals are equal. No animal shall drink alcohol, wear clothes, sleep in a bed, or kill a fellow four-footed creature. Those that go upon four legs or wings are friends and the two-legged are, by definition, the enemy. Too soon, however, the pigs, who have styled themselves leaders by virtue of their intelligence, succumb to the temptations of privilege and power. ""We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organisation of the farm depend on us. Day and night, we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples."" While this swinish brotherhood sells out the revolution, cynically editing the Seven Commandments to excuse their violence and greed, the common animals are once again left hungry and exhausted, no better off than in the days when humans ran the farm. Satire Animal Farm may be, but it's a stony reader who remains unmoved when the stalwart workhorse, Boxer, having given his all to his comrades, is sold to the glue factory to buy booze for the pigs. Orwell's view of Communism is bleak indeed, but given the history of the Russian people since 1917, his pessimism has an air of prophecy. --Joyce Thompson",,Paperback,9.78014E+12,95,3.9,2236991,42225,Animal Farm,Classics|Fiction|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Fantasy|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1356444159l/822477.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Science Fiction,Dystopia

Progressivamente, porém, a revolução degenera numa tirania ainda mais opressiva que a dos humanosEscrita em plena Segunda Guerra Mundial e publicada em 1945 depois de ter sido rejeitada por várias editoras, essa pequena narrativa causou desconforto ao satirizar ferozmente a ditadura stalinista numa época em que os soviéticos ainda eram aliados do Ocidente na luta contra o eixo nazifascista.De fato, são claras as referências: o despótico Napoleão seria Stálin, o banido Bola-de-Neve seria Trotsky, e os eventos políticos - expurgos, instituição de um estado policial, deturpação tendenciosa da História - mimetizam os que estavam em curso na União Soviética.Com o acirramento da Guerra Fria, as mesmas razões que causaram constrangimento na época de sua publicação levaram A Revolução Dos Bichos a ser amplamente usada pelo Ocidente nas décadas seguintes como arma ideológica contra o comunismo.

103,J.K. Rowling|Mary GrandPré,"Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts is full of new dangers. A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.--scholastic.com",,Mass Market Paperback,9.78044E+12,435,4.55,2217128,42873,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Fantasy|Young Adult|Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1499277281l/5.jpg,Fantasy,Young Adult,Fiction,

31181,Stieg Larsson|Paulo Neves,"Vem da Suécia um dos maiores êxitos no gênero de mistério dos últimos anos: a trilogia Millennium - da qual este romance, Os homens que não amavam as mulheres, é o primeiro volume. Seu autor, Stieg Larsson, jornalista e ativista político muito respeitado na Suécia, morreu subitamente em 2004, aos cinqüenta anos, vítima de enfarte, e não pôde desfrutar do sucesso estrondoso de sua obra. Seus livros não só alcançaram o topo das vendas nos países em que foram lançados (além da própria Suécia, onde uma em cada quatro pessoas leu pelo menos um exemplar da série, a Alemanha, a Noruega, a Itália, a Dinamarca, a França, a Espanha, a Itália, a Espanha e a Inglaterra), como receberam críticas entusiasmadas.O motivo do sucesso reside em vários fronts. Um deles é a forma original com que Larsson engendra a trama, fazendo-a percorrer variados aspectos da vida contemporânea, da ciranda financeira feita de corrupção à invasão de privacidade, da violência sexual contra as mulheres aos movimentos neofascistas e ao abuso de poder de uma maneira geral. Outro é a criação de personagens extremamente bem construídos e originais, como a jovem e genial hacker Lisbeth Salander, magérrima, com o corpo repleto de piercings e tatuagens e comportamento que beira a delinqüência. O terceiro é a maestria em conduzir a narrativa, repleta de suspense da primeira à última página.Os homens que não amavam as mulheres é um enigma a portas fechadas - passa-se na circunvizinhança de uma ilha. Em 1966, Harriet Vanger, jovem herdeira de um império industrial, some sem deixar vestígios. No dia de seu desaparecimento, fechara-se o acesso à ilha onde ela e diversos membros de sua extensa família se encontravam. Desde então, a cada ano, Henrik Vanger, o velho patriarca do clã, recebe uma flor emoldurada - o mesmo presente que Harriet lhe dava, até desaparecer. Ou ser morta. Pois Henrik está convencido de que ela foi assassinada. E que um Vanger a matou. Quase quarenta anos depois, o industrial contrata o jornalista Mikael Blomkvist para conduzir uma investigação particular. Mikael, que acabara de ser condenado por difamação contra o financista Wennerström, preocupa-se com a crise de credibilidade que atinge sua revista, a Millennium. Henrik lhe oferece proteção para a Millennium e provas contra Wennerström, se o jornalista consentir em investigar o assassinato de Harriet. Mikael descobre que suas inquirições não são bem-vindas pela família Vanger, e que muitos querem vê-lo pelas costas. De preferência, morto. Com o auxílio de Lisbeth Salander, que conta com uma mente infatigável para a busca de dados - de preferência, os mais sórdidos -, ele logo percebe que a trilha de segredos e perversidades do clã industrial recua até muito antes do desaparecimento ou morte de Harriet. E segue até muito depois.... até um momento presente, desconfortavelmente presente.",,Paperback,9.78854E+12,528,4.13,2184424,64924,Os Homens que Não Amavam as Mulheres,Fiction|Mystery|Thriller|Mystery|Crime,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1434480906l/25733088.jpg,Fiction,Mystery,Thriller,Mystery

127,J.K. Rowling|Mary GrandPré,"When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince opens, the war against Voldemort has begun. The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles. Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes on.Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams, start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once named Tom Riddle—the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes: objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if he dares splinter that soul through murder.Harry must use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final secret out of one of Riddle’s teachers, the sly Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord’s weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes Dumbledore’s own vulnerabilities, and casts Harry’s—and Hogwarts’s—future in shadow.Source: http://harrypotter.scholastic.com",,Paperback,9.78044E+12,652,4.55,1991117,31620,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Fantasy|Young Adult|Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361039191l/1.jpg,Fantasy,Young Adult,Fiction,

Agora, a trama sobre o casamento que sai tragicamente dos eixos chega aos cinemas, numa superprodução da Twentieth Century Fox dirigida por David Fincher (A rede social e Clube da luta) e estrelada por Ben Affleck e Rosamund Pike. O roteiro é assinado pela própria Gillian Flynn.O livro começa no dia do quinto aniversário de casamento de Nick e Amy Dunne, quando a linda e inteligente esposa de Nick desaparece da casa deles às margens do rio Mississippi. Sinais indicam que se trata de um sequestro violento e Nick rapidamente se torna o principal suspeito. Sob pressão da polícia, da mídia e dos ferozmente amorosos pais de Amy, Nick desfia uma série interminável de mentiras, meias verdades e comportamento inapropriado. Ele é evasivo e amargo — mas seria um assassino? Ao mesmo tempo, passagens do diário de Amy revelam um casamento tumultuado — mas ela estaria contando toda a história?Alternando entre os pontos de vista de Nick e Amy, Flynn cria uma aura de dúvidas em que o cenário muda a cada capítulo. À medida que as revelações surgem, fica claro que, se existe alguma verdade nos discursos de Nick e Amy, ela é mais sombria, distorcida e assustadora do que podemos imaginar.

At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable tale about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”",Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century,Paperback,9.78014E+12,182,3.66,1840595,30634,Lord of the Flies,Classics|Fiction|Young Adult|Academic|School|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327869409l/7624.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Young Adult,Academic

21,William Shakespeare|Barbara A. Mowat|Paul Werstine,"In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a world of violence and generational conflict in which two young people fall in love and die because of that love. The story is rather extraordinary in that the normal problems faced by young lovers are here so very large. It is not simply that the families of Romeo and Juliet disapprove of the lover's affection for each other; rather, the Montagues and the Capulets are on opposite sides in a blood feud and are trying to kill each other on the streets of Verona. Every time a member of one of the two families dies in the fight, his relatives demand the blood of his killer. Because of the feud, if Romeo is discovered with Juliet by her family, he will be killed. Once Romeo is banished, the only way that Juliet can avoid being married to someone else is to take a potion that apparently kills her, so that she is burried with the bodies of her slain relatives. In this violent, death-filled world, the movement of the story from love at first sight to the union of the lovers in death seems almost inevitable.What is so striking about this play is that despite its extraordinary setting (one perhaps reflecting Elizabethan attitudes about hot-blooded Italians), it has become the quintessential story of young love. Because most young lovers feel that they have to overcome giant obstacles in order to be together, because they feel that they would rather die than be kept apart, and especially because the language Shakespeare gives his young lovers is so exquisite, allowing them to say to each other just what we would all say to a lover if we only knew how, it is easy to respond to this play as if it were about all young lovers rather than about a particular couple in a very unusual world. (When the play was rewritten in the eighteen century as The History and Fall of Caius Marius, the violent setting became that of a particularly discordant period in classical Rome; when Leonard Berstein rewrote the play as West Side Story, he chose the violent world of New York street gangs.)",New Folger edition,Mass Market Paperback,9.78074E+12,283,3.74,1818262,16442,Romeo and Juliet,Classics|Plays|Fiction|Romance|Academic|School|Drama|Academic|Read For School|Literature|Young Adult|High School|Poetry,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327872146l/18135.jpg,Classics,Plays,Fiction,Romance

23972,Kathryn Stockett|Paola Frezza Pavese,"È l'estate del 1962 quando Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan torna a vivere in famiglia a Jackson, in Mississippi, dopo aver frequentato l'università lontano da casa. Skeeter è molto diversa dalle sue amiche di un tempo, già sposate e perfettamente inserite in un modello di vita borghese, e sogna in segreto di diventare scrittrice. Aibileen è una domestica di colore. Saggia e materna, ha allevato amorevolmente uno dopo l'altro diciassette bambini bianchi, facendo le veci delle loro madri spesso assenti. Ma il destino è stato crudele con lei, portandole via il suo unico figlio. Minny è la sua migliore amica. Bassa, grassa, con un marito violento e una piccola tribù di figli, è con ogni probabilità la donna più sfacciata e insolente di tutto il Mississippi. Cuoca straordinaria, non sa però tenere a freno la lingua e viene licenziata di continuo. Sono gli anni in cui Bob Dylan inizia a testimoniare con le sue canzoni la protesta nascente, e il colore della pelle è ancora un ostacolo insormontabile. Nonostante ciò, Skeeter, Aibileen e Minny si ritrovano a lavorare segretamente a un progetto comune che le esporrà a gravi rischi. Il profondo Sud degli Stati Uniti fa da cornice a questa opera prima che ruota intorno ai sentimenti, all'amicizia e alla forza che può scaturire dal sostegno reciproco.

Drie vrouwen zijn het allesbepalende racisme meer dan zat en besluiten dat de verschillen tussen hen minder belangrijk zijn dan de overeenkomsten.Het is 1962 en de 23-jarige Eugenia, door iedereen Skeeter genoemd, besluit een carrière als schrijfster na te jagen. Naar een onderwerp hoeft ze niet ver te zoeken, als op een dag haar vriendin Hilly vertelt over haar missie in alle huizen van blanke gezinnen een apart toilet te installeren voor de zwarte hulp. Hoe meer Hilly gebrand is op deze vorm van segregatie, hoe meer Skeeter twijfelt aan de 'gewone' manier van doen. Ze begint de verhalen te verzamelen van zwarte vrouwen die als hulp in de huishouding werken. De eerste die haar verhaal aan Skeeter durft te vertellen is Aibileen. Ze heeft als hulp al zeventien blanke kinderen opgevoed, maar als haar eigen zoon Treelore verongelukt op zijn werk, kijken de blanke bazen de andere kant uit.

28,Kathryn Stockett,"Be prepared to meet three unforgettable women:Twenty-two-year-old Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from Ole Miss. She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen’s best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody’s business, but she can’t mind her tongue, so she’s lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women — mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends — view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.",,Hardcover,9.7804E+12,465,4.46,1790905,80741,The Help,Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Historical|Adult,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1346100365l/4667024.jpg,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction,Historical

47,Alice Sebold,"The Lovely Bones is the story of a family devastated by a gruesome murder -- a murder recounted by the teenage victim. Upsetting, you say? Remarkably, first-time novelist Alice Sebold takes this difficult material and delivers a compelling and accomplished exploration of a fractured family's need for peace and closure.The details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school. Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed. But what the reader knows, her family does not. Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished.Sebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some. But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part.

33,John Steinbeck,"The compelling story of two outsiders striving to find their place in an unforgiving world. Drifters in search of work, George and his simple-minded friend Lennie have nothing in the world except each other and a dream--a dream that one day they will have some land of their own. Eventually they find work on a ranch in California’s Salinas Valley, but their hopes are doomed as Lennie, struggling against extreme cruelty, misunderstanding and feelings of jealousy, becomes a victim of his own strength. Tackling universal themes such as the friendship of a shared vision, and giving voice to America’s lonely and dispossessed, Of Mice and Men has proved one of Steinbeck’s most popular works, achieving success as a novel, a Broadway play and three acclaimed films.","Steinbeck Centennial Edition, US / CAN Edition",Paperback,9.78014E+12,112,3.85,1662561,27999,Of Mice and Men,Classics|Fiction|Academic|School|Literature|Historical|Historical Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511302904l/890.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Academic,School

Er ist nämlich, wie er als Ich-Erzähler von sich selbst in einer Vorbemerkung sagt, „bemüht, dieser ganzen Angelegenheit eine fröhliche Seite zu verleihen“. Nur hätten die meisten Menschen „einen tief sitzenden Widerwillen, der es ihnen unmöglich macht, mir zu glauben, so sehr ich auch versuche, sie davon zu überzeugen“. Mit einem weiteren Vorurteil räumt der Tod gleich zu Beginn auf, dass ihm nämlich die Menschen gleichgültig seien. Im Gegenteil. Ab und zu, so erfahren wir, braucht er sogar eine Auszeit, um sich abzulenken. „Ihr wollt wissen“, fragt er, „wovon ich mich ablenken muss? (…) Es sind die übrig gebliebenen Menschen. / Die Überlebenden.“ Eine solche Überlebende, „eine Expertin im Zurückbleiben“ ist die neunjährige Liesel Memminger. Von ihr handelt dieses wunderbare Buch. Zum ersten Mal begegnet der Tod der neunjährigen Liesel 1939 am Grab ihres kleinen Bruders, wo sie auch ihre Karriere als Bücherdiebin beginnt: Mit Hilfe des Handbuchs für Totengräber lernt sie das Lesen und muss fortan immer wieder Bücher stehlen. Sie „rettet“ auch welche -- vor den Flammen der Nazis. Und hin und wieder bekommt sie auch welche geschenkt. Ihre Liebe zu Büchern muss es sein, die den Tod, der sich selbst hier als großer Erzähler erweist, die Liesel lieb gewinnen lässt. Während um sie herum Bombenhagel alles in Schutt und Asche legen, findet sie Schutz im Keller – und in ihren Büchern. Der Tod, den der Autor uns hier präsentiert, muss man in der Tat nicht fürchten. Er ist weder böse noch kaltblütig. Und er hat eine Schwäche für Menschen, die lesen und die Bücher lieben. Ist das nicht beruhigend?

La Morte non ha mai avuto tanto da fare, ed è solo l'inizio.Il giorno del funerale del suo fratellino, Liesel Meminger raccoglie un oggetto seminascosto nella neve, qualcosa di sconosciuto e confortante al tempo stesso, un libriccino abbandonato lì, forse, o dimenticato dai custodi del minuscolo cimitero. Liesel non ci pensa due volte, le pare un segno, la prova tangibile di un ricordo per il futuro: lo ruba e lo porta con sé. Così comincia la storia di una piccola ladra, la storia d'amore di Liesel con i libri e con le parole, che per lei diventano un talismano contro l'orrore che la circonda. Grazie al padre adottivo impara a leggere e ben presto si fa più esperta e temeraria: prima strappa i libri ai roghi nazisti perché «ai tedeschi piaceva bruciare cose. Negozi, sinagoghe, case e libri», poi li sottrae dalla biblioteca della moglie del sindaco, e interviene tutte le volte che ce n'è uno in pericolo. Lei li salva, come farebbe con qualsiasi creatura.

In this richly annotated, illustrated edition, Daniel Shealy illuminates the novel s deep engagement with issues such as social equality, reform movements, the Civil War, friendship, love, loss, and of course the passage into adulthood.The editor provides running commentary on biographical contexts (Did Alcott, like Jo, have a mood pillow ?), social and historical contexts (When may a lady properly decline a gentleman s invitation to dance?), literary allusions (Who is Mrs. Malaprop?), and words likely to cause difficulty to modern readers (What is a velvet snood? A pickled lime?). With Shealy as a guide, we appreciate anew the confusions and difficulties that beset the March sisters as they overcome their burdens and journey toward maturity and adulthood: beautiful, domestic-minded Meg, doomed and forever childlike Beth, selfish Amy, and irrepressible Jo.

77,Louisa May Alcott,"Generations of readers young and old, male and female, have fallen in love with the March sisters of Louisa May Alcott’s most popular and enduring novel, Little Women. Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.It is no secret that Alcott based Little Women on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with �woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the �girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.",,Paperback,9.78045E+12,449,4.05,1429608,19045,Little Women,Classics|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Young Adult,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388269517l/1934.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction

Highly original and imaginative, this debut novel raises questions about life, love, and the effects of time on relationships.Audrey Niffenegger’s innovative debut, The Time Traveler’s Wife, is the story of Clare, a beautiful art student, and Henry, an adventuresome librarian, who have known each other since Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. Impossible but true, because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences unpredictable, alternately harrowing and amusing.

43968,Ray Bradbury,"In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury's classic, frightening vision of the future, firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books. Bradbury's vividly painted society holds up the appearance of happiness as the highest goal--a place where trivial information is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Fire Captain Beatty explains it this way, ""Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs.... Don't give them slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy.""  Guy Montag is a book-burning fireman undergoing a crisis of faith. His wife spends all day with her television ""family,"" imploring Montag to work harder so that they can afford a fourth TV wall. Their dull, empty life sharply contrasts with that of his next-door neighbor Clarisse, a young girl thrilled by the ideas in books, and more interested in what she can see in the world around her than in the mindless chatter of the tube. When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Montag is moved to make some changes, and starts hiding books in his home. Eventually, his wife turns him in, and he must answer the call to burn his secret cache of books. After fleeing to avoid arrest, Montag winds up joining an outlaw band of scholars who keep the contents of books in their heads, waiting for the time society will once again need the wisdom of literature. Bradbury--the author of more than 500 short stories, novels, plays, and poems, including The Martian Chronicles and The Illustrated Man--is the winner of many awards, including the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America.

162,Elizabeth Gilbert,"A celebrated writer's irresistible, candid, and eloquent account of her pursuit of worldly pleasure, spiritual devotion, and what she really wanted out of life. Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly. An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.",,Paperback,9.78014E+12,334,3.53,1305657,51368,"Eat, Pray, Love",Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Travel,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1503066414l/19501.jpg,Nonfiction,Autobiography,Memoir,Travel

No rastro do sucesso de outros títulos de fantasia, como Harry Potter e O senhor dos anéis, Eragon também chega às telas dos cinemas mundiais em 2006, pela Fox.Lançado inicialmente com a ajuda da família, quando Paolini ainda era aluno do ensino médio e tinha apenas 15 anos, o livro chegou rapidamente às mãos do editor Alfred A. Knopf e se transformou em sucesso mundial de vendas, comercializado pela gigante Random House. Nos Estados Unidos, o título manteve-se por 52 semanas no topo da lista dos mais vendidos. Em apenas seis meses, Eragon foi reeditado por três vezes na Turquia. Na Espanha, a edição de 80 mil exemplares esgotou-se em apenas um mês. Na Polônia, o título de Paolini só perde em vendas para o O Código Da Vinci e já vendeu 45 mil exemplares.Eragon é uma história repleta de ação, vilões e locais fantásticos, com dragões e elfos, cavaleiros, luta de espada, inesperadas revelações e uma linda donzela. Inspirado em J.R.R. Tolkien, que criou idiomas para os diálogos de seus personagens, Paolini utiliza o norueguês medieval para a linguagem dos elfos e inventa expressões específicas para os anões e os urgals, de modo a dar veracidade ao lendário reino de Alagaësia, onde a guerra está prestes a começar.O protagonista é um jovem de 15 anos que, ao encontrar na floresta uma pedra azul polida, se vê da noite para o dia no meio de uma disputa pelo poder do Império, na qual ele é a peça principal. A vida de Eragon muda radicalmente ao descobrir que a pedra azul é, na realidade, um ovo de dragão. Quando a pedra se rompe e dela nasce Saphira, Eragon é forçado a se converter em herói.Involuntariamente, o jovem é lançado para um arriscado mundo novo movido pelas tramas do destino, da magia e do poder. Empunhando apenas uma espada lendária e seguindo as sábias palavras de um velho contador de histórias, Eragon e o leal dragão terão de se aventurar por terras perigosas e enfrentar inimigos das trevas em um Império governado por um rei cuja maldade não conhece fronteiras.A Eragon foi dada a responsabilidade de alcançar a glória dos lendários heróis da Ordem dos Cavaleiros de Dragões. Será que conseguirá vencer os obstáculos que o destino lhe reservou? As escolhas de Eragon poderão salvar – ou destruir – o mundo em que vive.",Brazilian Portuguese,Paperback,9.78853E+12,480,3.88,1243285,19693,Eragon,Fantasy|Young Adult|Fiction|Fantasy|Dragons,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1392249354l/8707187.jpg,Fantasy,Young Adult,Fiction,Fantasy

Can Eragon take up the mantle of the legendary Dragon Riders?When Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest, he thinks it is the lucky discovery of a poor farm boy; perhaps it will buy his family meat for the winter. But when the stone brings a dragon hatchling, Eragon realizes he has stumbled upon a legacy nearly as old as the Empire itself. Overnight his simple life is shattered, and he is thrust into a perilous new world of destiny, magic, and power. With only an ancient sword and the advice of an old storyteller for guidance, Eragon and the fledgling dragon must navigate the dangerous terrain and dark enemies of an Empire ruled by a king whose evil knows no bounds. Can Eragon take up the mantle of the legendary Dragon Riders? The fate of the Empire may rest in his hands. . . .",,Paperback,9.78038E+12,503,3.88,1242665,19685,Eragon,Fantasy|Young Adult|Fiction|Fantasy|Dragons,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1366212852l/113436.jpg,Fantasy,Young Adult,Fiction,Fantasy

O livro descreve uma sociedade futura em que as pessoas seriam condicionadas em termos genéticos e psicológicos, a fim de se conformarem com as regras sociais dominantes. Tal sociedade dividir-se-ia em castas e desconheceria os conceitos de família e de moral. Contudo, esse mundo quase irrespirável não deixa de gerar os seus anticorpos. Bernard Marx, o protagonista, sente-se descontente com ele, em parte por ser fisicamente diferente dos restantes membros da sua casta. Então, numa espécie de reserva histórica em que algumas pessoas continuam a viver de acordo com valores e regras do passado, Bernard encontra um jovem que irá apresentar à sociedade asséptica do seu tempo, como um exemplo de outra forma de ser e de viver. Sem imaginar sequer os problemas e os conflitos que essa sua decisão provocará. Admirável Mundo Novo é um aviso, um apelo à consciência dos homens.

The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories. . . until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes.

51891,Emily Brontë,"WUTHERING HEIGHTS is Emily Brontë’s only novel. Written between October 1845 and June 1846, Wuthering Heights was published in 1847 under the pseudonym “Ellis Bell”; Brontë died the following year, aged 30. Wuthering Heights and Anne Brontë’s Agnes Grey were accepted by publisher Thomas Newby before the success of their sister Charlotte's novel, Jane Eyre. After Emily’s death, Charlotte edited the manuscript of Wuthering Heights, and arranged for the edited version to be published as a posthumous second edition in 1850. Although Wuthering Heights is now widely regarded as a classic of English literature, contemporary reviews for the novel were deeply polarised; it was considered controversial because its depiction of mental and physical cruelty was unusually stark, and it challenged strict Victorian ideals of the day, including religious hypocrisy, morality, social classes and gender inequality. The English poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti referred to it as “A fiend of a book – an incredible monster [...] The action is laid in hell, – only it seems places and people have English names there.” In the second half of the 19th century, Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre was considered the best of the Brontë sisters’ works, but following later re-evaluation, critics began to argue that Wuthering Heights was superior. The book has inspired adaptations, including film, radio and television dramatisations, a musical by Bernard J. Taylor, a ballet, operas (by Bernard Herrmann, Carlisle Floyd, and Frédéric Chaslin), a role-playing game, and a 1978 song by Kate Bush.",Wisehouse Classics Edition,Kindle Edition,,220,3.84,1121946,29429,Wuthering Heights,Classics|Fiction|Romance|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1472119279l/31678234.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Romance,Literature

34706,Philip Pullman,"Some books improve with age--the age of the reader, that is. Such is certainly the case with Philip Pullman's heroic, at times heart-wrenching novel, The Golden Compass, a story ostensibly for children but one perhaps even better appreciated by adults. The protagonist of this complex fantasy is young Lyra Belacqua, a precocious orphan growing up within the precincts of Oxford University. But it quickly becomes clear that Lyra's Oxford is not precisely like our own--nor is her world. For one thing, people there each have a personal dæmon, the manifestation of their soul in animal form. For another, hers is a universe in which science, theology, and magic are closely allied:  As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins. She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really. Probably the stars had dæmons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them.  Not that Lyra spends much time worrying about it; what she likes best is ""clambering over the College roofs with Roger the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war."" But Lyra's carefree existence changes forever when she and her dæmon, Pantalaimon, first prevent an assassination attempt against her uncle, the powerful Lord Asriel, and then overhear a secret discussion about a mysterious entity known as Dust. Soon she and Pan are swept up in a dangerous game involving disappearing children, a beautiful woman with a golden monkey dæmon, a trip to the far north, and a set of allies ranging from ""gyptians"" to witches to an armor-clad polar bear.  In The Golden Compass, Philip Pullman has written a masterpiece that transcends genre. It is a children's book that will appeal to adults, a fantasy novel that will charm even the most hardened realist. Best of all, the author doesn't speak down to his audience, nor does he pull his punches; there is genuine terror in this book, and heartbreak, betrayal, and loss. There is also love, loyalty, and an abiding morality that infuses the story but never overwhelms it. This is one of those rare novels that one wishes would never end. Fortunately, its sequel, The Subtle Knife, will help put off that inevitability for a while longer. --Alix Wilber",Adult Edition,Paperback,9.78044E+12,399,3.96,1094702,17128,Northern Lights,Fantasy|Young Adult|Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348114772l/45492.jpg,Fantasy,Young Adult,Fiction,

Gennem hans hudløst ærlige breve udfoldes en smuk og forvirrende teenageverden af første dates, venskaber, forelskelse, ensomhed, alkohol, sex og stoffer. Men også dybt begravede minder, familiedramaer og tragiske skæbner spiller ind i Charlies gribende og tankevækkende fortælling. FORDELENE VED AT VÆRE EN BÆNKEVARMER er en ung roman med en gammel sjæl og bør læses af både unge mennesker og voksne. ”Romanen er en fortælling om at blive voksen i tradition med The Catcher in the Rye ... [Chboskys] rørende refleksioner over livet, kærligheden og venskaber er ofte inspirerende og altid smukt skrevet.” –USA TODAY Er netop blevet kåret som verdens 16.-bedste ungdomsroman nogensinde på det anerkendte NPR.org blandt 1200 nominerede bøger. Over 75.000 unge deltog i afstemningen. På grund af romanens mange 'kontroversielle' emner er den blevet forbudt i undervisningen i en række stater i USA. Romanen skabte røre da den udkom, og lever nu som kultbog som teenagere ofte giver videre til hinanden. Stephen Chbosky er med denne roman en af de forfattere der er forsøgt bortcensureret og forbudt flest gange hos American Library Association det seneste årti. Stephen Chbosky bor i USA.

26066,Stephen Chbosky|Chiara Brovelli,"Fra un tema su Kerouac e uno sul Giovane Holden, tra una citazione da L'attimo fuggente e una canzone degli Smiths, scorrono i giorni di un adolescente per niente ordinario. L'ingresso nelle scuole superiori lo lancia in un vortice di prime volte: la prima festa, la prima rissa, il primo amore - per la bellissima ragazza con gli occhi verdi che quando lo guarda fa tremare il mondo. Il primo bacio, e lei gli dice: per te sono troppo grande, però possiamo essere amici.Per compensare, Charlie trova una che non gli piace e parla troppo: a sedici anni fa il primo sesso, e non sa neanche perché. Allora lui, più portato alla riflessione che all'azione, affida emozioni, trasgressioni e turbamenti a una lunga serie di lettere indirizzate a un amico, al quale racconta ciò che vive, che sente, che ha intorno.Dotato di un'innata gentilezza d'animo e di un dono speciale per la poesia, il ragazzo è il confidente perfetto di tutti, quello che non dimentica mai un compleanno, quello che non tradisce mai e poi mai un segreto.

46344,Antoine de Saint-Exupéry|Joana Varela,"Antoine de Saint-Exupéry publicou pela primeira vez «O Principezinho» em 1943, quando recuperava de ferimentos de guerra em Nova Iorque, um ano antes do seu avião Lockheed P-38 ter sido dado como desaparecido sobre o Mar Mediterrâneo, durante uma missão de reconhecimento. Mais de meio século depois, a sua fábula sobre o amor e a solidão não perdeu nenhuma da sua força, muito pelo contrário: este livro que se transformou numa das obras mais amadas e admiradas do nosso tempo, é na verdade de alcance intemporal, podendo ser inspirador para leitores de todas as idades e de todas as culturas.O narrador da obra é um piloto com um avião avariado no deserto do Sahara, que, tenta desesperadamente, reparar os danos causados no seu aparelho. Um belo dia os seus esforços são interrompidos devido à aparição de um pequeno príncipe, que lhe pede que desenhe uma ovelha. Perante um domínio tão misterioso, o piloto não se atreveu a desobedecer e, por muito absurdo que pareça - a mais de mil milhas das próximas regiões habitadas e correndo perigo de vida - pegou num pedaço de papel e numa caneta e fez o que o principezinho tinha pedido. E assim tem início um diálogo que expande a imaginação do narrador para todo o género de infantis e surpreendentes direcções. «O Principezinho» conta a sua viagem de planeta em planeta, cada um sendo um pequeno mundo povoado com um único adulto. Esta maravilhosa sequência criativa evoca não apenas os grandes contos de fadas de todos os tempos, como também o extravagante «Cidades Invisíveis» de Ítalo Calvino.

28022,Kurt Vonnegut,"Alternate-Cover Edition for this ASIN can be found hereSlaughterhouse-Five is the story of Billy Pilgrim, an ill-trained American soldier and his experience in World War IIWar is inevitable, and it is absurd. The main theme of the book focuses on this. Billy Pilgrim is a prisoner-of-war at the hands of the Germans. He is captured and put in a disused slaughterhouse, which eventually proves to be a safe ‘shelter’ when his life is spared during the bombing of Dresden.Billy is a fatalist. Barely out of childhood, his lack of enthusiasm for war and the eventual consequences of the war on his life is what makes up the story of Billy’s life. Vonnegut uses Billy to show that war is unnecessarily glorified, due to which people overlook the real tragedies and trauma that war actually brings with it.Billy’s journey through time and space, his accounts of the bombing at Dresden, and his life as a prisoner of war, all highlight the central theme in the novel, war is nothing but another form of hell. Dark humour and irony is what makes Slaughterhouse-Five unique and a perfect example of creative accomplishment. It conveys the bitterness of war, while providing comic relief along with crucial understanding of the working of the human mind.",ISBN: 9780795302664,Kindle Edition,,285,4.07,978277,22349,Slaughterhouse-Five,Classics|Fiction|Science Fiction|War,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335834458l/8704823.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Science Fiction,War

Al borde de la muerte, el doctor Frankenstein confiesa que se encuentra en plena persecución de lo que ha sido su más macabro y monstruoso experimento y origen de todos sus males. Con sus propias manos ha dado vida a un ser de aspecto abominable, que se ha vuelto en contra de él y desde entonces ha tenido que enfrentarse al rechazo y el maltrato de un mundo que lo aisló hasta la desesperación.

31260,Orson Scott Card,"Winner of the Hugo and Nebula AwardsIn order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister.Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",,Kindle Edition,,226,4.3,965908,40305,Ender's Game,Science Fiction|Fiction|Young Adult|Fantasy,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1452898522l/8045789.jpg,Science Fiction,Fiction,Young Adult,Fantasy

The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.com","Author's Definitive Edition, Revised mass market edition  (US / CAN)",Mass Market Paperback,9.78081E+12,324,4.3,965351,40289,Ender's Game,Science Fiction|Fiction|Young Adult|Fantasy,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408303130l/375802.jpg,Science Fiction,Fiction,Young Adult,Fantasy

Cuando el zapatero le ofrece cobijo en su casa, que deberá compartir con Mariam, entre las dos mujeres se inicia una relación que acabará siendo tan profunda como la de dos hermanas, tan fuerte como la de madre e hija. Pese a la diferencia de edad y las distintas experiencias que la vida les ha deparado, la necesidad de afrontar las terribles circunstancias que las rodean —tanto de puertas adentro como en la calle, donde la violencia política asola el país—, hará que Mariam y Laila vayan forjando un vínculo indestructible que les otorgará la fuerza necesaria para superar el miedo y dar cabida a la esperanza.",,Paperback,9.7885E+12,382,4.35,961826,47065,Mil soles espléndidos,Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1238731035l/3184678.jpg,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction,

If Offred refuses to enter into sexual servitude to repopulate a devastated world, she will be hanged. Yet even a repressive state cannot eradicate hope and desire.

Difred, la donna che appartiene a Fred, ha solo un compito nella neonata Repubblica di Galaad: garantire una discendenza alla élite dominante.

19040,Margaret Atwood,"The Handmaid's Tale is not only a radical and brilliant departure for Margaret Atwood, it is a novel of such power that the reader will be unable to forget its images and its forecast. Set in the near future, it describes life in what was once the United States, now called the Republic of Gilead, a monotheocracy that has reacted to social unrest and a sharply declining birthrate by reverting to, and going beyond, the repressive intolerance of the original Puritans. The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men of its population. The story is told through the eyes of Offred, one of the unfortunate Handmaids under the new social order. In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment's calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions. The Handmaid's Tale is funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing. It is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and tour de force.

This #1 New York Times bestselling, modern classic in which boys are forced to dig holes day in and day out is now available with a splashy new look.Stanley Yelnats is under a curse. A curse that began with his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather and has since followed generations of Yelnatses. Now Stanley has been unjustly sent to a boys' detention center, Camp Green Lake, where the boys build character by spending all day, every day digging holes exactly five feet wide and five feet deep. There is no lake at Camp Green Lake. But there are an awful lot of holes.It doesn't take long for Stanley to realize there's more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is looking for something. But what could be buried under a dried-up lake? Stanley tries to dig up the truth in this inventive and darkly humorous tale of crime and punishment--and redemption.Includes a double bonus: an excerpt from Small Steps,  the follow-up to Holes,  as well as an excerpt from Louis Sachar's new middle-grade novel, Fuzzy Mud.

18709,Louis Sachar|Birgitt Kollmann,"""Wenn man einen schlechten Jungen jeden Tag in der heißen Sonne ein Loch graben lässt, wird aus ihm schließlich ein guter Junge."" So lautet die herrschende Philosophie im Camp Green Lake, einer Jugendstrafanstalt, in der es weder einen grünen See noch fröhliche Sommerfreizeitler gibt. An der Stelle des einst größten Sees von Texas befindet sich heute eine trockene, flache und von der Sonne ausgedorrte Einöde, übersät mit unzähligen, völlig gleichen Löchern, die von Jungen gegraben wurden, um ihren Charakter zu verbessern. Stanley Yelnats, mit seinem palindromischen Namen und unglückseligen Stammbaum, landete in Camp Green Lake, weil es als die bessere Alternative zum Gefängnis erschien. Unabhängig davon, dass seine Verurteilung auf der Grundlage einer falschen Indentifizierung beruht, hat sich die Yelnats-Familie längst an eine lange Familiengeschichte der Glücklosigkeit gewöhnt, dank ihres ""elenden Tunichtgut und Schweinediebs von Ururgroßvater!"" Trotz seiner Unschuld, wird Stanley rasch in die Routine von Camp Green Lake eingebunden: vor Sonnenaufgang aufstehen, um ein Loch von fünf Fuß Durchmesser und fünf Fuß Tiefe zu graben; lernen, wie man mit der Horde von Jungs in Gruppe D zurechtkommt, die nach einem Herr-der-Fliegen-Muster gestrickt zu sein scheinen; und sich vor der Wärterin fürchten, die sich ihre Fingernägel mit Klapperschlangengift lackiert. Als Stanley aber dahinterkommt, dass die Jungs möglicherweise nicht nur zur Verbesserung ihres Charakters Löcher graben, sondern weil die Wärterin etwas ganz Bestimmtes sucht, wird die Handlung genauso heftig wie die Ironie. Dies ist eine seltsame Geschichte, sie ist aber auch auf seltsame Weise bezwingend und schön. Mit pokergesichtiger Untertreibung schafft Louis Sachar eine bizarre, jedoch glaubwürdige Welt, in der sich Major Major Major Major von Catch-22 so richtig zu Hause fühlen würde. Aber obwohl die Geschichte vor Humor und Absurdem nur so strotzt, zeigt sie auch ein tiefes Verständnis für die Bedeutung von Freundschaft wie auch ein glühendes Mitgefühl für die Schwächeren der Gesellschaft. Als Stanley unbewusst beginnt, sein Schicksal zu erfüllen -- die zwei Handlungen der Geschichte laufen zusammen, um zu zeigen, dass das Schicksal große Pläne auf Lager hat -- kommen wir nicht umhin, den Guten zuzujubeln, und all den Yelnats, wo immer sie auch sind. --Bragien Davis",,Paperback,9.78341E+12,296,3.94,843397,17610,Löcher.

29894,Jane Austen,"In its marvelously perceptive portrayal of two young women in love, Sense and Sensibility is the answer to those who believe that Jane Austen’s novels, despite their perfection of form and tone, lack strong feeling. Its two heroines, Marianne and Elinor—so utterly unlike each other–both undergo the most violent passions when they are separated from the men they love. What differentiates them, and gives this extraordinary book its complexity and brilliance, is the way each expresses her suffering: Marianne–young, impetuous, ardent–falls into paroxysms of grief when she is rejected by the dashing John Willoughby; while her sister, Elinor—wiser, more sensible, more self-controlled—masks her despair when it appears that Edward Ferrars is to marry the mean-spirited and cunning Lucy Steele. All, of course, ends happily—but not until Elinor’s “sense” and Marianne’s “sensibility” have equally worked to reveal the profound emotional life that runs beneath the surface of Austen’s immaculate and irresistible art.(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)","Everyman's Library Classics, #51",Hardcover,9.78068E+12,367,4.06,839308,13027,Sense and Sensibility,Classics|Fiction|Romance|Historical|Historical Fiction|Literature|Historical,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428946529l/467994.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Romance,Historical

Cette version diffère considérablement du manuscrit qu’il avait soumis quelques mois plus tôt au Lippincott's Magazine où le roman devait paraître en prépublication. Le directeur, par pruderie, l'avait sérieusement raboté, ce qui ne l'a pas empêché de provoquer un premier soulèvement d'indignation. Par la suite, Wilde a augmenté et remanié son roman, estompant ses passages les plus audacieux. La critique instruisait déjà son procès en immoralité. Il a fallu attendre 2011 pour que, en Angleterre, des universitaires rendent disponible le texte initial, avant les censures successives. C’est cette version que les Cahiers rouges publient pour la première fois en France.La trame reste inchangée. Dans le Londres fin de siècle, le peintre Basil Hallward tombe en adoration devant son modèle, le beau Dorian Gray. Leur chaste idylle commence, troublée par l'intervention d'un vieux camarade de Hallward, Lord Henry. Dandy hédoniste amoureux des bons mots, affichant avec insolence son homosexualité, il convainc Dorian de l'importance capitale de sa beauté. Un jour viendra où la vieillesse l'aura défiguré et plus personne ne le regardera. Horrifié, Dorian conclut un pacte faustien avec le portrait que Hallward a peint de lui : ce n'est plus lui que le temps abîmera, mais l’image du tableau. Le Portrait de Dorian Gray non censuré est encore plus délicieusement décadent et surtout plus ouvertement homosexuel. Le pouvoir érotique de Dorian est exacerbé, nombre de phrases rendent indubitable et intense la nature des sentiments de Hallward pour lui. On retrouvera bien sûr les saillies du spirituel Lord Henry, notamment le fameux :« De nos jours on sait le prix de tout, mais on ne connaît la valeur de rien. »",Les Cahiers Rouges,Paperback,9.78225E+12,224,4.06,776177,22958,Le Portrait de Dorian Gray - Non Censuré,Fiction|Classics|Horror|Fantasy,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492763064l/33178384.jpg,Fiction,Classics,Horror,Fantasy

31481,Homer|Albert Stanburrough Cook,"By its evocation of a real or imaged heroic age, its contrasts of character and its variety of adventure, above all by its sheer narrative power, the Odyssey has won and preserved its place among the greatest tales in the world. It tells of Odysseus' adventurous wanderings as he returns from the long war at Troy to his home in the Greek island of Ithaca, where his wife Penelope and his son Telemachus have been waiting for him for twenty years. He meets a one-eyed giant, Polyphemus the Cyclops; he visits the underworld; he faces the terrible monsters Scylla and Charybdis; he extricates himself from the charms of Circe and Calypso. After these and numerous other legendary encounters he finally reaches home, where, disguised as a beggar, he begins to plan revenge on the suitors who have for years been besieging Penelope and feasting on his own meat and wine with insolent impunity.",Norton Critical Edition,Paperback,9.78039E+12,414,3.74,767187,9528,The Odyssey,Classics|Fiction|Poetry|Fantasy|Mythology|Fantasy|Academic|School|Literature|Adventure|Academic|Read For School|Historical|Historical Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386919431l/267754.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Poetry,Fantasy

55,Homer|Robert Fagles|Bernard Knox,"Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turnsdriven time and again off course, once he had plunderedthe hallowed heights of Troy.So begins Robert Fagles' magnificent translation of the Odyssey, which Jasper Griffin in The New York Times Review of Books hails as ""a distinguished achievement.""If the Iliad is the world's greatest war epic, then the Odyssey is literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey though life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation.This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.--Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.",,Paperback,9.78014E+12,541,3.74,766893,9519,The Odyssey,Classics|Fiction|Poetry|Fantasy|Mythology|Fantasy|Academic|School|Literature|Adventure|Academic|Read For School|Historical|Historical Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390173285l/1381.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Poetry,Fantasy

47551,Frances Hodgson Burnett,"""One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance. Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911. The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle's vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven't heard, spiking Mary's curiosity. The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett's works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy. The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world's major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan. It remains a popular and beloved story of a child's journey into maturity, and a must-read for every child, parent, teacher and anyone who would enjoy this fascinating glimpse of childhood.

Noted outdoor writer and mountaineer Jon Krakauer tackles that question in his reporting on Chris McCandless, whose emaciated body was found in an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness in 1992. Described by friends and relatives as smart, literate, compassionate and funny, did McCandless simply read too much Thoreau and Jack London and lose sight of the dangers of heading into the wilderness alone? Krakauer, whose own adventures have taken him to the perilous heights of Everest, provides some answers by exploring the pull the outdoors, seductive yet often dangerous, has had on his own life.",,Mass Market Paperback,9.78033E+12,205,3.96,748877,18935,Into The Wild,Nonfiction|Biography|Adventure|Travel,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327249090l/1390754.jpg,Nonfiction,Biography,Adventure,Travel

He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body.

In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented.

Audioknihu předčítá Martin Stránský.Na podkladě více než čtyřiceti rozhovorů s Jobsem provedených v průběhu dvou let - a stejně tak interview s více než stovkou členů jeho rodiny, přátel, konkurentů, soupeřů i kolegů - pojednává tato kniha o životě plném vrcholů i propastí a o pronikavě intenzivní osobnosti tvořivého podnikatele, jehož vášeň pro dokonalost a železné odhodlání zcela převrátilo šest odvětví lidské činnosti: osobní počítače, kreslené filmy, hudbu, telefony, počítačové tablety a digitální tisk. V době, kdy se společnosti po celém světě snaží vybudovat ekonomiku digitálního věku, stojí Jobs v popředí jako nejvyšší ikona v oboru vynalézání nových věcí a představivosti uvedené do praxe. Věděl, že nejlepší způsob, jak vytvořit v 21. století nějaké hodnoty, je ve spojení kreativity a technologie, takže vybudoval firmu, kde jsou převratné nápady kombinovány s pozoruhodnými technickými počiny. Ačkoli Jobs na tomto životopisu spolupracoval, nesnažil se o žádnou kontrolu toho, co už bylo napsáno, ani nechtěl mít právo přečíst si knihu předtím, než bude vydána. „Udělal jsem hodně věcí, na něž nejsem pyšný, jako když jsem dostal svou přítelkyni ve 23 letech do jiného stavu a jak jsem se s tím vypořádal,“ přiznal se. „Ale nemám ve skříni žádné kostlivce, kteří by nesměli ven.“ Jobs mluvil otevřeně, občas dokonce krutě o lidech, s nimiž pracoval či proti nimž vystupoval. A podobně si i jeho přátelé, nepřátelé a kolegové vytvořili nepřikrášlený pohled na vášně, démony, perfekcionismus, touhy, dovednost, ďábelskost a posedlost pro vedení, které tvarovaly jeho přístup k podnikání i k novátorským výrobkům, jež byly toho všeho důsledkem.Jobs doháněl lidi kolem sebe k zuřivosti a zoufalství. Ale jeho osobnost a výrobky se tak vhodně doplňovaly, stejně jako se o to snažil u hardwaru a softwaru Applu, jako by to byla součást jakéhosi integrovaného systému.

905,Lauren Weisberger,"A delightfully dishy novel about the all-time most impossible boss in the history of impossible bosses. Andrea Sachs, a small-town girl fresh out of college, lands the job “a million girls would die for.” Hired as the assistant to Miranda Priestly, the high-profile, fabulously successful editor of ""Runway ""magazine, Andrea finds herself in an office that shouts ""Prada! Armani! Versace!"" at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about “The Boss from Hell.” Narrated in Andrea’s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda’s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day—and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.",,Paperback,9.78031E+12,432,3.72,727638,8503,The Devil Wears Prada,Womens Fiction|Chick Lit|Fiction|Contemporary|Romance,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388179604l/5139.jpg,Womens Fiction,Chick Lit,Fiction,Contemporary
47106,Charles Dickens,"This is the alternate cover edition for ""A Tale of Two Cities"" by Charles Dickens for ASIN number:B004EHZXVQ can be found here.""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times""The story is set in the late 18th century against the background of the French Revolution. Although Dickens borrowed from Thomas Carlyle's history, The French Revolution, for his sprawling tale of London and revolutionary Paris, the novel offers more drama than accuracy. The scenes of large-scale mob violence are especially vivid, if superficial in historical understanding. The complex plot involves Sydney Carton's sacrifice of his own life on behalf of his friends Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette. While political events drive the story, Dickens takes a decidedly antipolitical tone, lambasting both aristocratic tyranny and revolutionary excess--the latter memorably caricatured in Madame Defarge, who knits beside the guillotine. When former aristocrat Charles Darnay learns that an old family servant needs his help, he abandons his safe haven in England and returns to Paris. But once there, the Revolutionary authorities arrest him not for anything he has done, but for his rich family's crimes. Also in danger: his wife, Lucie, their young daughter, and her aged father, who have followed him across the Channel.",,Kindle Edition,,341,3.82,725587,14596,A Tale of Two Cities,Classics|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1310124698l/9847899.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction

'Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death; -- the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!'
After eighteen years as a political prisoner in the Bastille, the ageing Doctor Manette is finally released and reunited with his daughter in England. There the lives of two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil roads of London, they are drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror, and they soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine.This edition uses the text as it appeared in its serial publication in 1859 to convey the full scope of Dickens's vision, and includes the original illustrations by H. K. Browne ('Phiz'). Richard Maxwell's introduction discusses the intricate interweaving of epic drama with personal tragedy.--back cover","Penguin, UK / CAN / USA",Paperback,9.78014E+12,489,3.82,725258,14580,A Tale of Two Cities,Classics|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344922523l/1953.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction

32417,Stieg Larsson,"""Não há inocentes. Apenas diferentes graus de responsabilidade"", raciocina Lisbeth Salander, protagonista de A menina que brincava com fogo, de Stieg Larsson. O autor - um jornalista sueco especializado em desmascarar organizações de extrema direita em seu país - morreu sem presenciar o sucesso de sua premiada saga policial, que, somente na Europa, já vendeu mais de 6,5 milhões de exemplares. Nada é o que parece ser nas histórias de Larsson. A própria Lisbeth parece uma garota frágil, mas é uma mulher determinada, ardilosa, perita tanto nas artimanhas da ciberpirataria quanto nas táticas do pugilismo, que sabe atacar com precisão quando se vê acuada. Mikael Blomkvist pode parecer apenas um jornalista em busca de um furo, mas no fundo é um investigador obstinado em desenterrar os crimes obscuros da sociedade sueca, sejam os cometidos por repórteres sensacionalistas, sejam os praticados por magistrados corruptos ou ainda aqueles perpetrados por lobos em pele de cordeiro. Um destes, o tutor de Lisbeth, foi morto a tiros. Na mesma noite, contudo, dois cordeiros também foram assassinados: um jornalista e uma criminologista que estavam prestes a denunciar uma rede de tráfico de mulheres. A arma usada nos crimes - um Colt 45 Magnum - não só foi a mesma como nela foram encontradas as impressões digitais de Lisbeth. Procurada por triplo homicídio, a moça desaparece. Mikael sabe que ela apenas está esperando o momento certo para provar que não é culpada e fazer justiça - a seu modo. Mas ele também sabe que precisa encontrá-la o mais rapidamente possível, pois mesmo uma jovem tão talentosa pode deparar-se com inimigos muito mais formidáveis - e que, se a polícia ou os bandidos a acharem primeiro, o resultado pode ser funesto, para ambos os lados. A menina que brincava com fogo segue as regras clássicas dos melhores thrillers, aplicando-as a elementos contemporâneos, como as novas tecnologias e os ícones da cultura pop. O resultado é um romance ao mesmo tempo movimentado e sangrento, intrigante e impossível de ser deixado de lado.",,Paperback,9.78854E+12,608,4.23,717455,32500,A Menina que Brincava com Fogo,Fiction|Mystery|Thriller|Mystery|Crime,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1434480430l/25739345.jpg,Fiction,Mystery,Thriller,Mystery

25955,Rainbow Rowell,"Ovo je priča o dvoje buntovnika, Eleonori i Parku, čiji putevi su se ukrstili na čudesan način. Oboje veoma dobro znaju da prva ljubav nikad ne traje večno, ali su dovoljno hrabri i očajni da ipak pokušaju da to i ostvare. Kada Eleonora bude srela Parka, i mi se susrećemo s našim prvim ljubavima i svim teškoćama koje one donose. Ovo je roman o tinejdžerima, ali tema je toliko univerzalna da će svako ko je išao u srednju školu moći da se poistoveti sa našim junacima.Eleonora je nova u kraju, njena razbarušena riđa kosa i pocepana odeća nimalo joj ne pomažu da se uklopi u novu sredinu. Parka će sresti u školskom autobusu. Iako sede zajedno, nikada ne progovaraju ni reč, sve dok Park ne primeti da Eleonora krišom viri u stripove koje je stalno čitao, odudarajući tako od ostalih dečaka opsednutih sportom. Vremenom, stripove okreće sve više ka njoj kako bi i ona mogla da ih čita. Tako počinje njihova ljubavna priča.Polako, veza Eleonore i Parka se razvija, jedno drugom prave kompilacije na kasetama (radnja je smeštena u jednoj školskoj godini, 1986), raspravljaju o herojima iz X-mena, sve dok ne shvate da im je vožnja u školskom autobusu omiljeni deo dana. Ipak, stvari nisu tako jednostavne: Eleonoru maltretiraju druga deca u školi, a kod kuće je čeka još teža situacija u porodici. Parkovim roditeljima se u početku i ne sviđa njegova čudnjikava devojka.Ovo je priča o dvoje ljudi koji se bezgranično vole i koji veruju da mogu prevazići sve prepreke koje im stoje na putu ka sreći.Po ovoj knjizi snima se film u produkciji DreamWorksa.

The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders—Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon—who held sway over and age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky—a comet the color of blood and flame—six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard’s son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King’s Landing. Robert’s two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers. A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and wartime.

Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. And like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune—and remarkable power—to whoever can unlock them. For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday’s riddles are based in the pop culture he loved—that of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday’s icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes’s oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig.And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle.Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt—among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize.

Yüzyıllık Yalnızlık'ı iki yıldan daha kısa bir sürede yazdım, ama yazı makinemin başına oturmadan önce bu kitap hakkında düşünmek on beş, on altı yılımı aldı. Büyükannem, en acımasız şeyleri, kılını bile kıpırdatmadan, sanki yalnızca gördüğü olağan şeylermiş gibi anlatırdı bana. Anlattığı öyküleri bu kadar değerli kılan şeyin, onun duygusuz tavrı ve imgelerindeki zenginlik olduğunu kavradım. Yüzyıllık Yalnızlık'ı büyükannemin işte bu yöntemini kullanarak yazdım. Bu romanı dikkat ve keyifle okuyan, hiç şaşırmayan sıradan insanlar tanıdım.

37922,Gabriel García Márquez|Gregory Rabassa,"Alternate cover editions exists here and here.Winner of the 1982 Nobel Prize for LiteratureOne of the 20th century's enduring works, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize winning career.The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendía family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buendía family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel García Márquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.Alternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling.

48727,William Shakespeare,"Hamlet is Shakespeare’s most popular, and most puzzling, play. It follows the form of a “revenge tragedy,” in which the hero, Hamlet, seeks vengeance against his father’s murderer, his uncle Claudius, now the king of Denmark. Much of its fascination, however, lies in its uncertainties. Among them: What is the Ghost—Hamlet’s father demanding justice, a tempting demon, an angelic messenger? Does Hamlet go mad, or merely pretend to? Once he is sure that Claudius is a murderer, why does he not act? Was his mother, Gertrude, unfaithful to her husband or complicit in his murder?

46615,William Shakespeare,"Undoubtedly the most famous of all of Shakespeare's plays, Hamlet remains one of the most enduring but also enigmatic pieces of western literature. The story of Hamlet, the young Prince of Denmark, his tortured relationship with his mother, and his quest to avenge his father's murder at the hand of his brother Claudius has fascinated writers and audiences ever since it was written around 1600.  For many years interest focused on both Hamlet's inability to avenge his father's death, claiming that ""the native hue of resolution / Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought"", and, according to none other than Freud, his oedipal fixation with his mother. However, more recently critics have turned their attention to Hamlet's bold theatrical self-reflexivity (most famously reflected in the performance of ""The Mousetrap""), its fascination with issues of theology and Renaissance humanism, and its dense, complex poetic language. What is so remarkable about the play is the way in which it tends to uncannily reflect the concerns of different epochs. As a result, Hamlet has been at different moments defined as a romantic rebel, an angst-ridden existentialist, a paralysed intellectual and an ambivalent New Man. Whatever subsequent generations make of Hamlet, they are unlikely to exhaust the possibilities of this most extraordinary play. --Jerry Brotton",Penguin Popular Classics,Paperback,9.78014E+12,156,4.01,629253,10286,Hamlet,Classics|Plays|Fiction|Drama|Academic|School,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1366931642l/861453.jpg,Classics,Plays,Fiction,Drama

Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.",,Paperback,9.78081E+12,500,4.38,618976,43458,"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption",Nonfiction|History|Biography|War|War|World War II,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403879433l/18770394.jpg,Nonfiction,History,Biography,War

On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion.

53627,John Steinbeck|Robert DeMott|Mick Wiggins,"The Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression, a book that galvanized—and sometimes outraged—millions of readers. First published in 1939, Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads-driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America.  The Grapes of Wrath summed up its era in the way that Uncle Tom’s Cabin summed up the years of slavery before the Civil War. Sensitive to fascist and communist criticism, Steinbeck insisted that “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” be printed in its entirety in the first edition of the book—which takes its title from the first verse: “He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.” At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.

Και το πιο εντυπωσιακό από αυτά, είναι το πιο πολυσυζητημένο αμερικανικό βιβλίο του 20ού αιώνα.Από το 1939 που πρωτοεκδόθηκε, έχει κυκλοφορήσει σε εκατοντάδες εκατομμύρια αντίτυπα και έχει μεταφραστεί και ξαναμεταφραστεί στις περισσότερες γλώσσες.Η εποχή είναι η δεκαετία του '30, το μεγάλο κραχ, η αρχετυπική οικονομική κρίση που εντυπώθηκε με τρόμο στο συλλογικό φαντασιακό. Και ο λογοτέχνης που την περιέγραψε και την εξήγησε τόσο δυνατά και τόσο καθαρά, ώστε το έργο του θα μείνει για πάντα στην ιστορία, είναι ο Τζον Στάινμπεκ, με τα Σταφύλια της οργής.Η ιστορία μιας από τις χιλιάδες οικογένειες του αμερικανικού Νότου που έχασαν τα πάντα, εν μέσω της μεγάλης ύφεσης, όταν καταστράφηκαν οι σοδειές τους από την παρατεταμένη ξηρασία και από τους θυελλώδεις ανέμους. Με τα λιγοστά υπάρχοντά τους φορτωμένα σε ένα σαραβαλιασμένο φορτηγάκι ταξιδεύουν προς τη Γη της Επαγγελίας, την Καλιφόρνια, ελπίζοντας να βρουν δουλειά και ψωμί. Μα ακόμα και όταν φτάνουν στον προορισμό τους, δεν αργούν να αντιληφθούν ότι τα πράγματα δεν ήταν όπως είχαν ελπίσει.Τα Σταφύλια της οργής είναι ένας ύμνος στον άνθρωπο και στην ανθρωπιά, στη δύναμη της οικογένειας, στη μάχη για τον επιούσιο, στις μικρές πράξεις καλοσύνης των ανθρώπων.Ίσως πιο πολύ από κάθε άλλο βιβλίο, τούτο δω αποδεικνύει πως η μεγάλη λογοτεχνία δεν είναι ανάγκη να 'ναι ένας ερμητικός γρίφος, μα μπορεί με συγκλονιστικά άμεσες λέξεις και εικόνες να δονήσει την ψυχή κάθε ανθρώπου.

Particularized in the story of the Koad family, the movel is not only a powerful dramatization of the forced migration of the ""Okies"" from their bank-foreclesed fields and forams; it is a dramatization as well of the plight of the dispossessed everywhere. Written out of passionate conviction by a master storyteller, The Grapes of Wrath is both a great social document of an era and a milestone in American fiction.

At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.",75th Anniversary Edition,Hardcover,9.78067E+12,479,3.94,617033,14387,The Grapes of Wrath,Classics|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1513108059l/18114322.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction

126,Nathaniel Hawthorne|Thomas E. Connolly|Nina Baym,"Delve into The Scarlet Letter, Nathaniel Hawthorne's meditation on human alienation and its effect on the soul in this story set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts and be dazzled by literature. In Nathaniel Hawthorne's dark novel, The Scarlet Letter, a single sinful act ruins the lives of three people. None more so than Hester Prynne, a young, beautiful, and dignified woman, who conceived a child out of wedlock and receives the public punishment of having to always wear a scarlet ""A"" on her clothing. She refuses to reveal the father of her child, which could lighten her sentence. Her husband, the aptly-named Roger Chillingworth, who Hester thought had died in a shipwreck but was actually being held captive by Native Americans, arrives at the exact moment of her deepest public shaming and vows to get revenge. Her lover, Arthur Dimmesdale, remains safely unidentified, but is wracked with guilt. Though originally published in 1850, the story is set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts among Hawthorne's Puritan ancestors. In The Scarlet Letter, he created a story that highlighted both their weaknesses and their strengths. His knowledge of their beliefs and his admiration for their way of life was balanced by his concerns about their rigid and oppressive rules.Complete and unabridged, this elegantly designed, clothbound edition features an elastic closure and a new introduction by Mike Lee Davis.",Penguin Classics,Paperback,9.78014E+12,238,3.38,612448,12647,The Scarlet Letter,Classics|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Academic|School,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1404810944l/12296.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction

695,Steven D. Levitt|Stephen J. Dubner,"Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.",Revised and Expanded Edition,Hardcover,9.78006E+12,320,3.95,594154,14617,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics, #1)",Nonfiction|Economics|Business|Science|Psychology,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327909092l/1202.jpg,Nonfiction,Economics,Business,Science

52200,Victor Hugo|Julie Rose|Adam Thirwell,"Sensational, dramatic, packed with rich excitement and filled with the sweep and violence of human passions, Les Misérables is one of the greatest adventure stories ever told. It is a novel peopled by colourful characters from the nineteenth-century Parisian underworld; the street children, the prostitutes and the criminals. In telling the story of escaped convict Jean Valjean, and his efforts to reform his ways and care for the little orphan girl he rescues from a life of cruelty, Victor Hugo drew attention to the plight of the poor and oppressed. Les Miserables is a masterful detective story, a comic and tragic story of romance and revolution and, ultimately, a tale of redemption and hope.",,Hardcover,9.7801E+12,1330,4.15,592186,13073,Les Misérables,Classics|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320461350l/2451616.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction

46869,Victor Hugo|Norman Denny,"""He was no longer Jean Valjean, but No. 24601""Victor Hugo’s tale of injustice, heroism and love follows the fortunes of Jean Valjean, an escaped convict determined to put his criminal past behind him. But his attempts to become a respected member of the community are constantly put under threat: by his own conscience, when, owing to a case of mistaken identity, another man is arrested in his place; and by the relentless investigations of the dogged policeman Javert. It is not simply for himself that Valjean must stay free, however, for he has sworn to protect the baby daughter of Fantine, driven to prostitution by poverty. A compelling and compassionate view of the victims of early nineteenth-century French society, Les Misérables is a novel on an epic scale, moving inexorably from the eve of the battle of Waterloo to the July Revolution of 1830. Norman Denny’s introduction to his lively English translation discusses Hugo’s political and artistic aims in writing Les Misérables.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

It is your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.""With this proclamation of redemption, newly released prisoner Jean Valjean embarks on the path of virtue, and a classic of world literature soars. Les Misérables is the story of Jean Valjean's transformation from criminal to hero, and his dedication to doing good in a world where harsh laws often thwart the most benevolent impulses. Imprisoned for nineteen years after stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving family, Valjean is on track to become a repeat offender until a charitable bishop's act of pity compels him to transform into an honest man.Over the next two decades, Valjean becomes a successful businessman and a generous benefactor to is orphan ward, Cosette. But the implacable Inspector Javert, who knows of Valjean's criminal past and who enforces the law mercilessly, hounds him from town to town, seeking to apply a standard of justice that does not acknowledge either rehabilitation or renewal.A vivid historical romance whose events climax spectacularly during the Paris Uprising of 1832, Les Misérables was praised by Upton Sinclair as ""one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world.""

28328,Victor Hugo|Marisa Zini|Marc Le Cannu|Charles Baudelaire,"Meditato dall'autore fin dal 1845, I miserabili vide la luce solo nel 1862: diciassette anni impiegò infatti Hugo per scrivere e pubblicare quello che egli stesso riteneva il suo capolavoro, il punto culminante della sua già monumentale opera. Accolto freddamente dalla critica - con la sola, notevolissima eccezione di Rimbaud che ne parlò come di ""un vero poema"" -, il romanzo ottenne invece una strepitosa fortuna di pubblico: 3500 copie vendute in poche ore, collette popolari per acquistarlo, un vero e proprio movimento d'opinione che fece preoccupare seriamente il regime di Napoleone III, per non parlare delle innumerevoli traduzioni e riedizioni, versioni cinematografiche e teatrali, fumetti... Un successo vasto e durevole, dovuto alla straordinaria capacità di Hugo di sintetizzare la sua vocazione poetico-simbolica e quella realistico-sociale, dando così vita a un'opera in cui le vicende dei tanti, indimenticabili personaggi si intrecciano con la storia del popolo di Parigi e la rievocazione dei momenti cruciali della sua epopea, dalla battaglia di Waterloo ai moti insurrezionali del 1832.", Oscar classici #114,Cofanetto,9.7888E+12,1417,4.15,592094,13069,I Miserabili,Classics|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1372777168l/3646821.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction

29713,Vladimir Nabokov|E.H. Kahane,"Vladimir Nabokov: Sex, Lies, and Premium CableBy now, you undoubtedly know that Adrian Lyne's film version of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita received its much belated American debut on August 2nd, on Showtime, and will be released in theaters next month. You very likely also know that the movie was, well, not exactly banned, but effectively so, by the refusal of American film distributors to participate in its release. And you probably have a sense of what the fuss was all about: The film is reportedly too racy for American eyes. But there's a very different angle on this story to be found through a closer look at the novel.Nabokov's Lolita was originally published in 1955 and immediately became embroiled in its own censorship battles. The story is admittedly, purposefully, a shocking one: Humbert Humbert, an emigré academic, has a thing for young girls. Nymphets, he calls them, prepubescent girls who betray some precocious awareness of their own sensuality. Upon accepting a position at a new college, Humbert rents a room in town and falls madly, passionately, horrifyingly in love with his landlady's 12-year-old daughter, Dolores Haze, the Lolita of the novel's title. He marries Dolores's mother in order to maintain proximity to Dolores herself, and his relationship with her very quickly exceeds the bounds of stepfatherly affection. There are several upsetting things about this story, not the least of which is that, it appears, Lolita herself is the seducer, and Humbert the seducee. Hence the ubiquitous comparisons of any precociously sexual, slightly dangerous girl to this character (for example, the ""Long Island Lolita""). These comparisons -- and the moral censorship to which the novel has been subject -- are, however, based on a most superficial reading of the book, one that overlooks a basic literary concept: the unreliable narrator.Humbert Humbert is the one who tells us the story. From an insane asylum. He's a child molester and, ultimately, a murderer. Why on earth should we take his word for how it happened?This, in fact, is the real story of Lolita. The novel is about the ways in which a reader can be manipulated to feel sympathy for -- even to identify with -- the most horrifying person imaginable. That early readers of the novel were so shocked by Dolores's behavior -- so shocked, in fact, that governments moved to ban the book -- is precisely Nabokov's point: Rather than acknowledge the ultimate evil that lies under the otherwise charming persona, we as a culture are more inclined to turn him into a tragic hero, a victim.Lolita was, of course, filmed years ago by Stanley Kubrick. Nabokov wrote a screenplay for the movie that was ultimately cast aside. The Kubrick film is quirky, almost to a fault; Nabokov himself reportedly said that he liked the movie quite a lot, though it had nothing whatsoever to do with his novel. Kubrick managed to evade at least some of the moral terror surrounding his subject by casting Sue Lyons as Dolores. Lyons was 16 when the film was shot, a slightly too young woman rather than a child. Adrian Lyne has left himself no such comfort zone. While in London earlier this summer, I happily got a chance to see the new film and form my own opinions, the first of which is this: Dominique Swain is stunning as Dolores, one moment a seductress and the very next a gawky child. And Jeremy Irons's Humbert is passionate and terrifying. The film is lushly, beautifully shot -- uncomfortably so, at moments -- and quite faithful to the novel. At least to what the novel claims to say, what Humbert says it says. But the film misses, unfortunately, exactly what the critics all along have missed: Humbert Humbert is not to be trusted. This is, I suspect, one of the fundamental differences in narrative possibility between the novel and film, one that makes any complete adaptation of Lolita all but impossible: Film really has no equivalent to the unreliable narrator. Some films do experiment with multiple perspectives -- see, for instance, Kurosawa's Rashomon -- and so manage to cast doubt on any sense of truth. More recently, The Opposite of Sex presents a thoroughly untrustworthy narrator, but one who happily tells the audience when she's lying. But the puzzle presented by a narrator as charming and horrible as Humbert Humbert is perhaps one that can only be appreciated through the novel.Nabokov plays repeatedly throughout his novels with such narrative puzzles. Pale Fire, for instance, presents itself as the definitive annotated edition of the last poem of the late John Shade, with commentary by his faithful friend, Charles Kinbote. But the commentary has far more to do with Kinbote than it does with Shade's poem, and ultimately reveals that Kinbote may not be at all who he claims to be, and may in fact not be the identity he's hiding, either. Pnin is the third-person story of a befuddled Russian academic whose perceptions of reality seem more than a little skewed. Ada, or Ardor is the ultimate family romance, a philosophical treatise posing as a novel, annotated by Vivian Darkbloom (an anagram of Vladimir Nabokov and a character who receives brief mention in Lolita). And Despair is literally, as all of Nabokov's novels are figuratively, a mystery.These mysteries are the heart of Nabokov's writing, and though LOLITA appears a straightforward story, the reader should always be wary. My recommendations about Lolita: See the film. It's beautiful, it's compelling, and it's important. But more to the point: Read the novel. If you've never read it, I envy you the joys of your first encounter with it. If you've read it before, read it again; it offers up something new each time. As do all of Nabokov's intricate puzzles: Each text begs you to take it apart, look at it from the other side, figure out where the truth might actually lie.Kathleen Fitzpatrick",,Mass Market Paperback,9.78207E+12,501,3.89,565482,20409,Lolita,Classics|Fiction|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1179827733l/960514.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Literature,

It was first published in serial form in the publication All the Year Round from 1 December 1860 to August 1861. It has been adapted for stage and screen over 250 times.Great Expectations is the story of the orphan Pip, writing about his life (and attempting to become a gentleman along the way). The novel, like much of Dickens' work, draws on his experiences of life and people.The main plot of Great Expectations takes place between Christmas Eve 1812, when the protagonist is about seven years old (and which happens to be the year of Dickens' birth), and the winter of 1840.Great Expectations is written in first person and uses language and grammar that has, since the publication of Great Expectations, fallen out of common use. The title Great Expectations refers to the 'Great Expectations' Pip has of coming into his benefactor's property upon his disclosure to him and achieving his intended role as a gentleman at that time. Great Expectations is a bildungsroman, a novel depicting growth and personal development, in this case, of Pip.Some of the major themes of Great Expectations are crime, social class, empire and ambition. From an early age, Pip feels guilt; he is also afraid that someone will find out about his crime and arrest him. The theme of crime comes in to even greater effect when Pip discovers that his benefactor is in fact a convict. Pip has an internal struggle with his conscience throughout the book. Great Expectations explores the different social classes of the Georgian era. Throughout the book, Pip becomes involved with a broad range of classes, from criminals like Magwitch to the extremely rich like Miss Havisham. Pip has great ambition, as demonstrated constantly in the book.",,Kindle Edition,,642,3.76,562807,13566,Great Expectations,Classics|Fiction|Literature|Historical|Historical Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328314953l/10448083.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Literature,Historical

48537,Albert Camus|Vedat Günyol,"Albert Camus'nün (1913-1960) en tanınmış, en çok yabancı dile çevrilmiş, en çok incelenmiş ve hala en çok satan kitaplar arasında yer alan Yabancı, aynı zamanda yazarın en gizemli yapıtı. Ölümün egemen olduğu bir varlıkın en anlamsız olgularını saçma bir düzensizlik içinde yaşayan bu romanın başkişisi Meursault, bir simge kahraman değildir, adı olmayan bir Yabancıdır; bu eksik kimlik, gerçeklikten algıladığı şeyi yapılandıramayan, yeniden örgütleyemeyen, ama gerçekliğin yankılarını yakalamaya çalışan bir boş bilincin imgesidir. Onun kayıtsızlığı ve edilgenliği, işte bu boş bilincin ürünüdür. Yabancı, büyüleyici gücünü, içinde barındırdığı trajedi duygusuna borçlu: Bir türlü ele geçirilemeyen anlamın sürekli aranması, bilinç ile toplumsal dünya arasındaki çatışma... Camus'yle buluşanların hiçbiri, onunla karşılaşınca hayal kırıklığına uğramamıştır. Mutluluk, bir yerde ve her yerde hiçbir şey beklemeden dünyayı, insanları sevmektir, der Camus. Giderek daha çok sevilen bir yazar olması, onun bu sevgisinin yansımasından başka bir şey değildir.Albert Camus Cezayir doğumludur. Yoksul bir işçi olan babası I.

43180,Albert Camus,"Die Sonne sei Schuld gewesen, er habe den Araber am Strand nicht erschießen wollen. Mit dieser Erklärung erntet der Büroangestellte Meursault vor Gericht nur Gelächter. Der Staatsanwalt fordert seinen Kopf und klagt ihn der Unmenschlichkeit an. Meursaults grundlegende Schuld besteht jedoch darin, ein Sonderling zu sein, gesellschaftliche Spielregeln zu mißachten, am Grab seiner Mutter nicht geweint und tags drauf eine Liebschaft begonnen zu haben. Man wird lange suchen müssen nach einem Roman, in dem eine Philosophie (aus Camus' zeitgleich entstandenem Essay über das Absurde Der Mythos von Sisyphos) ähnlich elegant und überzeugend in Literatur verwandelt wird. Und erstaunlich, wie betörend klar und frisch die Sprache in Camus' frühem Meisterwerk heute noch wirkt, wie kunstvoll Aufbau und Motivführung sind. Meersault ist ein Anti-Held par excellence: Abgesehen von kleinen sinnlichen Genüssen lebt er unauffällig, gelangweilt und passiv sein unbedeutsames Leben. Er läßt sich treiben, wenn er nichts zu sagen hat, redet er auch nicht, und als ihn Maria fragt, ob er sie heiraten wolle, ringt er sich nur ein ""das ist mir einerlei"" ab. Erst angesichts des Todesurteils beginnt er nachzudenken und wird sich bewußt, daß er glücklich gewesen war und es immer noch ist. Als der Gefängnispriester ihn, den Ungläubigen, zu gottesfürchtiger Buße anhält, schleudert er ihm wütend sein eigenes Glaubensbekenntnis ""dieses ganzen absurden Lebens"" ins Gesicht und unterwirft sich endgültig ""der zärtlichen Gleichgültigkeit der Welt"", der er sich ""brüderlich"" verbunden fühlt. Er hat nur noch einen Wunsch: ""Am Tag meiner Hinrichtung viele Zuschauer, die mich mit Schreien des Hasses empfangen"". --Christian Stahl",,,9.7835E+12,122,3.97,556455,17630,Der Fremde,Classics|Fiction|Philosophy|Cultural|France|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1317833142l/997886.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Philosophy,Cultural

21448,Albert Camus|Matthew    Ward,"Since it was first published in English, in 1946, Albert Camus's extraordinary first novel, The Stranger (L'Etranger), has had a profound impact on millions of American readers. Through this story of an ordinary man who unwittingly gets drawn into a senseless murder on a sun-drenched Algerian beach, Camus was exploring what he termed ""the nakedness of man faced with the absurd.""Now, in an illuminating new American translation (the only English version available for more than forty years was done by a British translator), the original intent of The Stranger is made more immediate, as Matthew Ward captures in exact and lucid language precisely what Camus said and how he said it, thus giving this haunting novel a new life for generations to come.Albert Camus, son of a working-class family, was born in Algeria in 1913. He spent the early years of his life in North Africa, where he worked at Various jobs -- in the weather bureau, in an automobile-accessory firm, in a shipping company -- to help pay for his courses at the University of Algiers. He then turned to journalism as a career. His report on the unhappy state of the Muslims of the Kabylie region aroused the Algerian government to action and brought him public notice. From 1935 to 1938 he ran the Theatre de L'Equipe, a theatrical company that produced plays by Malraux, Gide, Synge, Dostoevski, and others. During World War II he was one of the leading writers of the French Resistance and editor of Combat, then an important underground newspaper. Camus was always very active in the theater, and several of his plays have been published and produced. His fiction, including The Stranger, The Plague, The Fall, and Exile and the Kingdom; his philosophical essays, The Myth of Sisyphus and The Rebel; and his plays have assured his preeminent position in modern French letters. In 1957 Camus was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. His sudden death on January 4, 1960, cut short the career of one of the most important literary figures of the Western world when he was at the very summit of his powers.",,Hardcover,9.78039E+12,144,3.97,556306,17622,The Stranger,Classics|Fiction|Philosophy|Cultural|France|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1329264355l/58197.jpg,Classics,Fiction,Philosophy,Cultural

49047,Tracy Chevalier,"The Dutch painter Vermeer has remained one of the great enigmas of 17th-century Dutch art. While little is known of his personal life, his extraordinary paintings of natural and domestic life, with their subtle play of light and colour, have come to define the Dutch Golden Age. The mysterious portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has fascinated art historians for centuries, and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title. Girl with a Pearl Earring centres on Vermeer's prosperous household in Delft in the 1660s. The appointment of the quiet, perceptive heroine of the novel, the servant Griet, gradually throws the household into turmoil as Vermeer and Griet become increasingly intimate, an increasingly tense situation that culminates in her working for Vermeer as his assistant, and ultimately sitting for him as a model. Chevalier deliberately cultivates a limpid, painstakingly observed style in homage to Vermeer, and the complex domestic tensions of the Vermeer household are vividly evoked, from the jealous, vain, young wife to the wise, taciturn mother-in-law. At times the relationship between servant and master seems a little anachronistic, but Girl with a Pearl Earring does contain a final delicious twist in its tail. Chevalier acknowledges her debt to Simon Schama's classic study of the Dutch Golden Age, The Embarrassment of Riches, and the novel comes hard on the heels of Deborah Moggach's similar tale of domestic intrigue behind the easel of 17th-century Dutch painting, Tulip Fever. Girl with a Pearl Earring is a fascinating piece of speculative historical fiction, but how much more can novelists extract from the Dutch Golden Age? --Jerry Brotton",,Paperback,9.78001E+12,308,3.86,550372,8621,Girl With A Pearl Earring,Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Classics|Art,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386923700l/4996.jpg,Historical,Historical Fiction,Fiction,Historical
